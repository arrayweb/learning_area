# Operators In Python : Assignment

## 1. What is the purpose of the '//' operator in Python when used with numerical values?

### The `//` operator in Python is called the **floor division operator**. It performs integer division, meaning it returns the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to the result of the division. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it's useful:

**1. Integer Division:**

- `//` always returns an integer value, even if the actual division result has a decimal part.
- It essentially rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.

**Example:**

```python
>>> 10 // 3
3 
>>> 7 // 2
3 
>>> -11 // 3
-4 
```

**2. Use Cases:**

- **Truncating Decimals:**  Useful when you only want the integer part of a division result, discarding the fractional part.
- **Dividing Whole Numbers:** Ideal for operations involving whole numbers where you need integer quotients.
- **Index Calculations:** When working with indices in arrays or lists, `//` can be used to calculate the correct index. 

**Example in Data Science:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Split the array into two chunks
chunk_size = 3
num_chunks = len(data) // chunk_size

# Get the indices for splitting the array
split_indices = [i * chunk_size for i in range(num_chunks + 1)]

print(split_indices)  # Output: [0, 3, 6]

# Split the array based on the indices
chunks = np.split(data, split_indices)

print(chunks)  # Output: [array([1, 2, 3]), array([4, 5])]
```

**Important Note:**

- If you need the full result of a division, including the decimal part, use the `/` (normal division) operator.

**In summary:**

The `//` operator in Python provides a convenient way to perform integer division, truncating decimals and ensuring the result is always an integer. This makes it useful for various data science tasks involving indexing, splitting data, and other operations that require integer quotients. 


## 2. How does the 'in' operator work in Python when dealing with data structures like lists or dictionaries?

### The `in` operator in Python is a powerful tool for checking if an element exists within a data structure. It's a fundamental part of data manipulation and conditional logic, particularly useful in data science. 

**How `in` Works:**

* **Membership Test:**  The `in` operator tests if a specified element is present within a given data structure.  
* **Return Value:** It returns `True` if the element is found and `False` otherwise.

**1. Lists:**

- `in` checks for the presence of an element in a list.
- It compares the element with each item in the list.
- The order of elements in the list matters.

**Example:**

```python
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in my_list)  # Output: True
print("orange" in my_list) # Output: False
```

**2. Dictionaries:**

- `in` checks for the presence of a *key* in a dictionary.
- It doesn't check for the presence of values.
- Key order doesn't matter in dictionaries.

**Example:**

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

print("name" in my_dict) # Output: True
print("city" in my_dict)  # Output: True
print("age" in my_dict)   # Output: True 
print("location" in my_dict) # Output: False 
print(30 in my_dict)     # Output: False (checks for keys, not values)
```

**3. Sets:**

- `in` checks for the presence of an element in a set.
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, so the order of elements doesn't matter.

**Example:**

```python
my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print("apple" in my_set)  # Output: True
print("orange" in my_set) # Output: False 
```

**Data Science Applications:**

* **Data Validation:**  Check if specific values exist in a dataset.
* **Conditional Logic:**  Control program flow based on the presence or absence of elements.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Create new features based on the presence of certain values in existing features.
* **Data Filtering:**  Select data points based on the presence or absence of certain values.

**Example in Data Science:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({"City": ["New York", "London", "Paris", "Tokyo"], 
                   "Product": ["Shoes", "Dress", "Bag", "Shoes"]})

# Filter rows where the product is "Shoes"
shoes_df = df[df["Product"] == "Shoes"]
print(shoes_df) 

# Check if a specific city is present in the dataset
if "Tokyo" in df["City"].values:
    print("Tokyo is in the dataset!")
```

**Conclusion:**

The `in` operator is a fundamental part of data manipulation in Python, providing a concise and efficient way to check for membership within data structures.  It's essential for data validation, conditional logic, feature engineering, and other data science tasks. 


## 3. Explain the usage of the 'lambda' operator in Python with respect to data science operations.

###  Lambda:  The Power of Tiny, Anonymous Functions in Data Science

The `lambda` operator in Python is a way to create small, anonymous functions. These functions are often referred to as "lambda functions" or "lambda expressions."  They are particularly useful in data science for creating concise and efficient functions on the fly, especially when you need a simple function for a specific operation within a larger workflow.

**Structure:**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

**Breakdown:**

* **`lambda`:** The keyword that signals the creation of an anonymous function.
* **`arguments`:** The input parameters the function takes.
* **`expression`:** The code that defines the function's behavior and returns a value.

**Example:**

```python
# Define a lambda function to square a number
square = lambda x: x**2

# Use the lambda function
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

**Data Science Applications:**

1. **Applying Functions to DataFrames:** Lambda functions are handy for creating custom transformations within pandas DataFrames using the `apply()` or `map()` methods.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 28]}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Use a lambda function to convert names to uppercase
   df['Name'] = df['Name'].apply(lambda name: name.upper())

   print(df)
   ```

2. **Creating Custom Functions for Aggregation:** Lambda functions can be used to define simple aggregation functions within pandas.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = {'Values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Use a lambda function to calculate the sum of squared values
   sum_of_squares = df['Values'].apply(lambda x: x**2).sum()

   print(sum_of_squares)
   ```

3. **Mapping and Filtering Data:** Lambda functions can be used within `map()` and `filter()` to apply transformations and filter data efficiently.

   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   # Square all numbers using map
   squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))

   # Filter for even numbers using filter
   even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

   print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
   print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]
   ```

4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Lambda functions can be used to apply simple data cleaning and transformation operations, such as removing whitespace, converting data types, or replacing values.

**Advantages of Lambda Functions:**

* **Conciseness:** They provide a concise and readable way to define simple functions.
* **Efficiency:**  They are often more efficient than creating separate named functions, especially for short operations.
* **Flexibility:** They can be used inline within other code, making them flexible for various data science tasks.

**Conclusion:**

Lambda functions are a powerful tool for data scientists in Python, enabling concise and efficient code for data manipulation, transformation, and analysis. They provide a flexible and expressive way to apply custom operations within data science workflows.




## 4. What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in Python? Provide an example related to data science.

###  `==` vs. `is`:  The Subtle Art of Comparing in Python

Both `==` and `is` operators are used for comparison in Python, but they have distinct purposes and behaviors, which are particularly important in data science:

**1. `==` (Equality Operator):**

* **Purpose:**  Checks for *value equality* between two objects.  It compares the *contents* of the objects to see if they are equivalent.
* **Behavior:** Returns `True` if the values of the objects are equal, `False` otherwise.

**2. `is` (Identity Operator):**

* **Purpose:** Checks for *object identity*. It compares whether two variables refer to the *same* object in memory. 
* **Behavior:** Returns `True` if both variables point to the same object in memory, `False` otherwise.

**Data Science Example:**

Let's consider a scenario where you're working with a Pandas DataFrame and want to compare two Series:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create two Series with identical values
series1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
series2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

# Compare using == (value equality)
print(series1 == series2)  # Output: True (the values are the same)

# Compare using is (object identity)
print(series1 is series2)  # Output: False (they are different objects)

# Create a copy of series1 
series3 = series1.copy()

# Compare using == (value equality)
print(series1 == series3)  # Output: True (the values are the same)

# Compare using is (object identity)
print(series1 is series3)  # Output: False (they are different objects)
```

**Explanation:**

* **`series1 == series2`:**  The `==` operator returns `True` because the Series have the same values.
* **`series1 is series2`:**  The `is` operator returns `False` because `series1` and `series2` are distinct objects in memory, even though they have the same values.
* **`series1 == series3`:** The `==` operator returns `True` because `series3` is a copy of `series1` with the same values.
* **`series1 is series3`:** The `is` operator returns `False` because `series1` and `series3` are different objects in memory, even though they have the same values.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Value Comparison:** Use `==` when you want to check if two objects have the same values.
* **Object Identity:** Use `is` when you want to check if two variables point to the same object in memory.
* **Data Science Relevance:**  In data science, the `is` operator is less commonly used than `==` because you often care about value equality, not object identity, when working with data. However, understanding the difference between these operators is important for avoiding unexpected behavior and correctly interpreting comparisons.




## 5. Discuss the significance of the 'any' and 'all' operators in Python when working on datasets in data science.

### `any` and `all`:  Powerful Tools for Data Exploration and Decision-Making

The `any` and `all` operators in Python provide a concise and efficient way to check for the existence of specific conditions within iterable data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.  They are particularly valuable in data science for:

**1. `any`:**

* **Purpose:**  Returns `True` if at least one element in an iterable evaluates to `True`. 
* **Use Cases:**
    - **Data Validation:**  Check if any element in a dataset meets a specific criteria.
    - **Data Filtering:**  Select data points where at least one condition is satisfied.
    - **Conditional Logic:**  Control program flow based on the presence of certain values.

**Example:**

```python
# Check if any element in a list is greater than 10
numbers = [1, 5, 8, 12, 2]
has_greater_than_10 = any(number > 10 for number in numbers)
print(has_greater_than_10) # Output: True 
```

**2. `all`:**

* **Purpose:** Returns `True` if all elements in an iterable evaluate to `True`. 
* **Use Cases:**
    - **Data Validation:**  Verify that all elements in a dataset meet specific criteria.
    - **Data Integrity:** Check if data is consistent and meets quality standards.
    - **Conditional Logic:**  Execute code only if all conditions are met.

**Example:**

```python
# Check if all elements in a list are positive
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
are_all_positive = all(number > 0 for number in numbers)
print(are_all_positive) # Output: True

numbers = [1, 2, -3, 4, 5]
are_all_positive = all(number > 0 for number in numbers)
print(are_all_positive) # Output: False 
```

**Data Science Applications:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Validation:**
   - **Missing Values:**  Check if any or all elements in a column are missing (`NaN`).
   - **Data Type Consistency:** Verify that all values in a column have the correct data type.
   - **Outlier Detection:**  Identify outliers by checking if any values exceed a certain threshold.

2. **Data Exploration and Filtering:**
   - **Subsetting Data:**  Select rows from a DataFrame where any or all conditions hold true.
   - **Groupby Operations:** Apply aggregation functions to groups that meet specific criteria.

3. **Machine Learning Model Evaluation:**
   - **Model Accuracy:**  Assess if the model meets a certain accuracy threshold on all data points or a subset of the data.
   - **Feature Selection:**  Identify features where all values are the same, potentially indicating irrelevant features.

**Conclusion:**

`any` and `all` provide a concise and efficient way to work with iterable data structures in Python.  They are particularly useful in data science for data cleaning, validation, exploration, filtering, and machine learning model evaluation.  Understanding their purpose and application will empower you to write more efficient and expressive code in your data science projects. 


## 6. How can the 'reduce' function from the 'functools' module be used in combination with operators for data manipulation in Python?

### `reduce` and Operators:  Folding Data with Power

The `reduce` function from the `functools` module in Python is a powerful tool for applying a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable.  It's particularly useful for combining or aggregating data, often in conjunction with Python operators. 

**1. Understanding `reduce`:**

* **Purpose:** `reduce` takes a function and an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) as input.  It applies the function to the first two elements of the iterable, then applies the function to the result and the next element, and so on, until it produces a single final result.
* **Syntax:**  `functools.reduce(function, iterable, initializer=None)`
    * **`function`:**  The function to apply cumulatively.
    * **`iterable`:** The sequence of elements to process.
    * **`initializer`:** An optional initial value for the accumulation.

**2. Combining `reduce` with Operators:**

* **Arithmetic Operators:**  Commonly used operators like `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `//` (floor division) can be used as the function within `reduce`.

   ```python
   from functools import reduce

   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   # Sum of numbers using + operator
   sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
   print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15

   # Product of numbers using * operator
   product_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
   print(product_of_numbers)  # Output: 120
   ```

* **Logical Operators:**  Operators like `and` and `or` can be used to perform logical operations on iterables.

   ```python
   # Check if all elements in a list are True
   all_true = reduce(lambda x, y: x and y, [True, True, True, False])
   print(all_true)  # Output: False

   # Check if any element in a list is True
   any_true = reduce(lambda x, y: x or y, [False, False, False, True])
   print(any_true)  # Output: True 
   ```

**3. Data Science Applications:**

* **Data Aggregation:**  Calculate sums, products, minimums, maximums, or other aggregations from datasets.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features by combining existing features using operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication.
* **Custom Functions:**  Apply user-defined functions cumulatively to data.

**Example in Data Science:**

```python
from functools import reduce

# Calculate the weighted average of prices
prices = [10, 15, 20]
weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]

weighted_average = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y[0] * y[1], zip(prices, weights), 0) / sum(weights)
print(weighted_average)  # Output: 16.5
```

**Key Points:**

* **Conciseness:** `reduce` provides a concise way to perform cumulative operations on iterables.
* **Flexibility:** It works with various operators and custom functions.
* **Efficiency:**  For certain operations, `reduce` can be more efficient than using explicit loops.

**Conclusion:**

The `reduce` function, combined with Python operators, provides a powerful tool for data manipulation in data science.  It enables efficient aggregation, feature engineering, and custom data processing, enhancing your data science toolkit.




## 7. Explain the role of the 'itemgetter' operator from the 'operator' module in Python when sorting or extracting specific elements from data structures.

###  `itemgetter`: A Precise Tool for Sorting and Extracting

The `itemgetter` function from the `operator` module in Python is a powerful tool for accessing specific elements from data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It's particularly useful when you need to sort or extract data based on certain indices or keys.

**How `itemgetter` Works:**

* **Function Creation:**  You use `itemgetter` to create a function that takes a data structure as input and returns the value(s) at the specified index(es) or key(s).
* **Usage:**  The resulting function can be applied to individual data structures or used within sorting or filtering operations.

**1. Sorting with `itemgetter`:**

* **Sorting by Multiple Columns:** When sorting lists of tuples or dictionaries, `itemgetter` allows you to sort based on specific elements or keys.

   ```python
   from operator import itemgetter

   data = [
       (1, "Alice", 25),
       (3, "Bob", 30),
       (2, "Charlie", 28)
   ]

   # Sort by the second element (name)
   sorted_data = sorted(data, key=itemgetter(1))
   print(sorted_data)  # Output: [(2, 'Charlie', 28), (1, 'Alice', 25), (3, 'Bob', 30)]

   # Sort by the first element (ID) and then the third element (age)
   sorted_data = sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0, 2))
   print(sorted_data)  # Output: [(1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Charlie', 28), (3, 'Bob', 30)]
   ```

**2. Extracting Elements with `itemgetter`:**

* **Concise Element Selection:**  `itemgetter` provides a more concise way to extract elements from data structures compared to traditional indexing.

   ```python
   data = [
       (1, "Alice", 25),
       (3, "Bob", 30),
       (2, "Charlie", 28)
   ]

   # Get the names (second element)
   names = list(map(itemgetter(1), data))
   print(names)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

   # Get the ages (third element)
   ages = list(map(itemgetter(2), data))
   print(ages)  # Output: [25, 30, 28] 
   ```

**3. Working with Dictionaries:**

* **Dictionary Sorting:** Use `itemgetter` to sort dictionaries by their keys or values. 

   ```python
   from operator import itemgetter

   data = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 28}

   # Sort by keys
   sorted_keys = sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0))
   print(sorted_keys)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

   # Sort by values
   sorted_items = sorted(data.items(), key=itemgetter(1))
   print(sorted_items)  # Output: [('Alice', 25), ('Charlie', 28), ('Bob', 30)]
   ```

**Data Science Applications:**

* **Data Exploration and Visualization:**  Extract specific columns from dataframes for plotting or analysis.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Create new features based on selected elements from existing features.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  Sort data based on specific columns or keys for further processing.
* **Algorithm Implementation:**  Use `itemgetter` to efficiently access data during algorithm execution.

**Conclusion:**

`itemgetter` provides a powerful and versatile way to interact with data structures in Python.  It simplifies sorting and element extraction, making it a valuable tool for data scientists working with various data formats.





## 8. Write a Python code snippet using the 'zip' function and an operator that concatenates elements from two lists into a new list.

#
```python
from operator import add

list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = ['x', 'y', 'z']

# Using zip and operator.add to concatenate elements
combined_list = [add(*pair) for pair in zip(list1, list2)]

print(combined_list)  # Output: ['ax', 'by', 'cz']
```


Explanation:

1. **Import `add` Operator:** The `add` function from the `operator` module is imported to perform the concatenation operation.
2. **`zip` Function:**  `zip(list1, list2)` creates pairs of corresponding elements from the two lists.
3. **List Comprehension:**  The list comprehension `[add(*pair) for pair in zip(list1, list2)]` iterates through the pairs created by `zip`.
    - `*pair` unpacks the elements from each pair.
    - `add(*pair)` applies the `add` operator to the unpacked elements, concatenating them.
4. **Combined List:** The resulting concatenated elements are collected into a new list, `combined_list`.

**Key Points:**

* **`zip` for Pairing:** The `zip` function is a powerful tool for iterating over multiple iterables simultaneously, creating pairs of corresponding elements.
* **`add` Operator:** The `add` operator from the `operator` module provides a concise way to perform concatenation.
* **List Comprehension:**  List comprehensions offer a compact and elegant way to create new lists based on existing iterables.

This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to combine the `zip` function with an operator to achieve a concise and efficient concatenation operation on two lists. 




## 9. Create a scenario-based example illustrating the practical use of the 'ternary operator' in Python for data processing tasks.

###  Ternary Operator:  A Concise Shortcut for Data Classification

Imagine you're working with a dataset of customer transactions, and you want to create a new column called "Transaction Category" based on the transaction amount:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
transactions = pd.DataFrame({
    'Amount': [100, 50, 200, 150, 300]
})

# Using a traditional if-else statement:
for i in range(len(transactions)):
    if transactions.Amount[i] < 100:
        transactions.loc[i, 'Transaction Category'] = 'Small'
    elif transactions.Amount[i] < 200:
        transactions.loc[i, 'Transaction Category'] = 'Medium'
    else:
        transactions.loc[i, 'Transaction Category'] = 'Large'

print(transactions)
```

This code works, but it's a bit verbose.  The ternary operator offers a more concise way to achieve the same result.

**Using the Ternary Operator:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
transactions = pd.DataFrame({
    'Amount': [100, 50, 200, 150, 300]
})

# Using the ternary operator
transactions['Transaction Category'] = ['Small' if amount < 100 else 'Medium' if amount < 200 else 'Large' for amount in transactions.Amount]

print(transactions)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Concise Expression:** The ternary operator `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false` condenses an `if-else` statement into a single line.
* **List Comprehension:**  The code uses a list comprehension to apply the ternary operator to each value in the `Amount` column.
* **New Column:**  A new column `Transaction Category` is created, containing the categorized values.

**Benefits of the Ternary Operator:**

* **Conciseness:** The ternary operator makes the code more compact and easier to read.
* **Efficiency:**  For simple conditional statements, it can be more efficient than traditional `if-else` statements.
* **Readability:** The code becomes more expressive, particularly when dealing with multiple nested conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The ternary operator is a powerful tool in Python for simplifying conditional logic.  It's particularly useful in data science for concisely applying conditions to data, creating new features, or performing data transformations.

This example demonstrates how the ternary operator can be used to efficiently categorize transaction amounts in a data science task. 


## 10.  Discuss how the logical 'and', 'or', and 'not' operators can be leveraged in Python for conditional data filtering in data science workflows.

###  Logical Operators: 

The logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` in Python are essential tools for conditional data filtering in data science workflows. They enable you to create complex filtering conditions based on multiple criteria, allowing you to select specific data points from datasets.

**1. `and` Operator:**

* **Purpose:** Returns `True` if *both* operands are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
* **Use Cases:**  Filter data where multiple conditions must be met simultaneously.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [25, 30, 28, 22, 40],
    'Income': [50000, 75000, 60000, 45000, 80000]
})

# Filter for customers who are older than 25 and have income greater than 60000
filtered_df = df[(df['Age'] > 25) and (df['Income'] > 60000)]
print(filtered_df) 
```

**2. `or` Operator:**

* **Purpose:** Returns `True` if *at least one* operand is `True`, otherwise returns `False`. 
* **Use Cases:** Filter data where at least one of several conditions is met.

**Example:**

```python
# Filter for customers who are either younger than 25 or have income less than 50000
filtered_df = df[(df['Age'] < 25) or (df['Income'] < 50000)]
print(filtered_df) 
```

**3. `not` Operator:**

* **Purpose:** Inverts the truth value of an operand.
* **Use Cases:**  Select data that does *not* meet a specific condition.

**Example:**

```python
# Filter for customers who are not older than 30
filtered_df = df[not (df['Age'] > 30)]
print(filtered_df)
```

**Data Science Applications:**

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - **Missing Values:**  Remove rows where any or all values are missing (`NaN`).
   - **Outlier Detection:**  Identify outliers by checking if any values exceed a certain threshold.
   - **Data Type Validation:** Verify that all values in a column have the correct data type.

2. **Data Exploration and Filtering:**
   - **Subsetting Data:**  Select rows from a DataFrame where specific conditions hold true.
   - **Groupby Operations:** Apply aggregations to data groups that meet certain criteria.

3. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - **Feature Selection:**  Identify features that meet certain conditions (e.g., features with high variance or correlation).
   - **Data Splitting:**  Divide data into training, validation, and test sets based on conditions.

**Conclusion:**

Logical operators are fundamental tools for conditional data filtering in data science workflows. They enable you to create complex filtering conditions, ensuring that you can efficiently select and manipulate data based on multiple criteria. Understanding and leveraging these operators is essential for data cleaning, exploration, and model development tasks. 




## 11. Explain the concept of 'bitwise operators' in Python and provide a data science-related example showcasing their usage.

### Bitwise Operators:  Unveiling the Bits in Data Science

Bitwise operators in Python work directly on the binary representation of numbers. They perform operations on individual bits, allowing for efficient manipulation of data at the lowest level.  While less common than arithmetic and logical operators in everyday data science, they have niche applications that can be quite powerful.

**Common Bitwise Operators:**

* **`&` (Bitwise AND):** Returns a 1 in each bit position where both operands have a 1.
* **`|` (Bitwise OR):** Returns a 1 in each bit position where either operand has a 1.
* **`^` (Bitwise XOR):** Returns a 1 in each bit position where the operands have different values.
* **`~` (Bitwise NOT):** Inverts the bits of the operand.
* **`<<` (Left Shift):** Shifts bits to the left, filling in with zeros on the right.
* **`>>` (Right Shift):** Shifts bits to the right, filling in with zeros or ones depending on the sign of the operand.

**Data Science Example:  Encoding Features with Bit Flags**

Imagine you have a dataset of customer profiles with various features, such as gender, age range, and location. You can use bitwise operations to create a single integer variable that encodes multiple features efficiently.

```python
# Define feature categories
GENDER_MALE = 1
GENDER_FEMALE = 2
AGE_YOUNG = 4
AGE_MIDDLE = 8
AGE_OLD = 16
LOCATION_CITY = 32
LOCATION_SUBURB = 64

# Create a customer profile
customer_features = {
    "gender": GENDER_MALE,
    "age": AGE_MIDDLE,
    "location": LOCATION_CITY

# Decode features using bitwise AND
decoded_gender = encoded_features & GENDER_MALE
decoded_age = encoded_features & AGE_MIDDLE
decoded_location = encoded_features & LOCATION_CITY

**Explanation:**

1. **Bit Flags:**  Each feature category is assigned a unique power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). This allows for independent representation of each feature.
2. **Encoding:**  Bitwise OR (`|`) is used to combine the bit flags corresponding to the customer's features into a single integer.
3. **Decoding:**  Bitwise AND (`&`) is used to extract the individual bit flags from the encoded value, allowing you to retrieve the original feature values.

**Benefits of Bitwise Encoding:**

* **Efficiency:**  Reduces memory usage by storing multiple features in a single integer.
* **Speed:**  Bitwise operations are generally fast, making this method efficient for processing large datasets.
* **Flexibility:**  Can be used for encoding various types of categorical features.

**Limitations:**

* **Limited Number of Features:**  The number of features you can encode is restricted by the maximum value of an integer.
* **Data Interpretation:**  Decoding the encoded value might be less intuitive compared to storing data in separate columns.

**Conclusion:**

While less common than other operators, bitwise operators have specific uses in data science for efficiently encoding and decoding features. This technique can improve memory usage and processing speed, particularly when dealing with large datasets and categorical features.
